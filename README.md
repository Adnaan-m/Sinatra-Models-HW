### Challenges
In regards to the challenges, it was mainly understanding the concepts of the syntax to create the server-side functionality. The ability to call classes within a class directly was found to be quite useful.

### Learning points
SQL ties in neatly with the optionality of selecting specific fields within the database and can provide great use for the front end as well in regards to form submission and indefinite field creation (which is accessed even if the site is closed down unlike javascript).
